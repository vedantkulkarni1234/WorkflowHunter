### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantkulkarni1234/WorkflowHunter.git
   cd bug-bounty-workflow-generator
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üìñ Usage

1. **Create a New Workflow**: Start with a blank canvas or load a template
2. **Add Steps**: Use the "Add Step" button to create new workflow steps
3. **Configure Steps**: Double-click on any step to edit its properties
4. **Connect Steps**: Hold Shift and drag between steps to create dependencies
5. **Execute Workflow**: Set your variables and click "Execute" to run your workflow

## üß† Key Components

### Workflow Canvas
The visual canvas allows you to design workflows by dragging and connecting steps. Each step can be configured with:
- Name and description
- Shell commands to execute
- Working directory
- Environment variables
- Dependencies on other steps
- Conditional execution logic

### Adaptive Neural Interface
The application learns from your usage patterns to provide personalized recommendations:
- Suggests frequently used steps based on context
- Recommends templates based on your current workflow
- Adapts the UI layout to your preferences

### Execution Engine
The robust execution engine handles:
- Sequential or parallel execution modes
- Variable substitution in commands
- Timeout management
- Error handling and retry logic
- Dry-run capability for testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Settings
Access the settings panel to configure:
- Autosave preferences
- Theme selection
- Animation settings
- Adaptive interface options

### Templates
Create reusable templates for common workflows:
- Subdomain enumeration
- Web application reconnaissance
- Vulnerability scanning
- Reporting workflows
